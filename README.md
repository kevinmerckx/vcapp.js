vcapp.js
========

Module to handle basic mobile app and view controller logic. You could find very complete MCV frameworks. This library aims at providing the very basic functionnality of a web application: view controllers logic. And only logic. Nothing more.

The advantage of such a library is to separate the logic from the style you may want to give to your application.
