vcapp.js
========

Module to handle basic mobile app and view controller logic. You could find very complete MVC frameworks. This library aims at providing the very basic functionnality of a web application: view controllers logic. And only logic. Nothing more.

The advantage of such a library is to separate the logic from the style you may want to give to your application: Bootstrap, Ionic, jQuery Mobile etc.

# How to use it?
Include one file.

```
<script src="vcapp/src/vcapp.min.js"></script>
```
